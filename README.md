## Description :closed_book:
EncrypThor was one of my project using Python (it was before COVID, in 2018 ... sweet souvenirs). 
EncrypThor is a file encryption method based on AES. It first encrypt the file with a key and then cut the file in multiples parts of random sizes. After that each block is encrypted again with a second key. Then, the result is zipped and encrypted again.

## Installation :computer:
Only one thing to do :
```pip install -r requirements.txt```

And then, you can use it as you want :smirk:


## Usage :sunglasses:
You have two choices :
1. Import the class and use the multiple functions to make your own scripts
2. Use the created functions EncrypThor_V1 ... etc.

## Contributing :couple:

1. Fork it
2. Create your feature branch (`git checkout -b my-new-feature`)
3. Commit your changes (`git commit -am 'Add some feature'`)
4. Push to the branch (`git push origin my-new-feature`)
